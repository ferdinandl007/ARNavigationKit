   pod 'ARNavigationKit','~> 0.1.0'


Please note this is still a work in progress with final release sometime in the Spring of 2020
This AR navigation kit is related to my bachelor thesis on autonomous indoor robotson so unfortunately I cannot accept any pull requests at this time
Once its final and working correctly I will also add documentation to make this easy to integrate into your project.
